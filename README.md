### 1. **Basic Calculator**
**File**: `Basic_Calculator.py`

This is a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), root calculations, and power calculations.

**Usage**:
Run the file and follow the on-screen instructions to input two numbers and select the desired operation.

---

### 2. **Divisibility Checker**
**File**: `Divisibility_Checker.py`

This script checks for numbers divisible by a user-specified divisor within a given range.

**Usage**:
Run the file, input the starting and ending number, and the divisor. The program will output all numbers in the range divisible by the divisor.

---

### 3. **Factorial Calculator**
**File**: `Factorial_Calculator.py`

This script calculates the factorial of a given number using both an iterative and recursive approach.

**Usage**:
Run the file and input the number for which you want to calculate the factorial. The script will display both the iterative and recursive results.

---

### 4. **Fibonacci Sequence Generator**
**File**: `Fibonacci_Sequence.py`

This script generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a user-defined number of terms.

**Usage**:
Run the file and enter the number of Fibonacci terms you want. The sequence will be printed to the console.

---

### 5. **GCD Calculator**
**File**: `GCD_Calculator.py`

This script calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.

**Usage**:
Run the file and input two numbers. The program will display their GCD.

---

### 6. **Interpolation & Extrapolation Calculator**
**File**: `Interpolation_Extrapolation_Calculator.py`

This script performs interpolation and extrapolation using Newton's divided difference method, based on user-defined data points.

**Usage**:
Run the file, input the number of points, and their x and y values. Then input the x value at which you want to perform the interpolation or extrapolation. The result will be displayed, and the graph will be plotted.

---

### 7. **Matrix Multiplication**
**File**: `Matrix_Multiplication.py`

This script multiplies two matrices provided by the user and returns the result.

**Usage**:
Modify the example matrices in the code, then run the file to view the resulting matrix product.

---

### 8. **Prime Number Checker**
**File**: `Prime_Number_Checker.py`

This script checks whether a given number is a prime number.

**Usage**:
Run the file and input a number. The program will determine whether the number is prime and display the result.

---

### 9. **Quadratic Equation Solver**
**File**: `Quadratic_Equation_Solver.py`

This script solves a quadratic equation of the form `ax^2 + bx + c = 0` and returns the roots (real or complex).

**Usage**:
Run the file, input the coefficients (a, b, and c), and the script will display the roots of the quadratic equation.

---

### 10. **Statistical Calculator**
**File**: `Statistical_Calculator.py`

This script calculates the mean, median, and mode of a list of numbers provided by the user.

**Usage**:
Run the file and input a list of numbers separated by spaces. The program will calculate and display the mean, median, and mode.

---

### 11. **Taylor Series Expansion**
**File**: `Taylor_Series_Expansion.py`

This script computes the Taylor series expansion of `e^x` up to a user-defined number of terms.

**Usage**:
Run the file, input the value of `x` and the number of terms for the Taylor series expansion. The result will be displayed.
